# Types of Recursion

## Overview
This video covers the different types of recursion in programming:
- **Tail Recursion**
- **Head Recursion** 
- **Tree Recursion**
- **Indirect Recursion**
- **Nested Recursion**

---

## 1. Tail Recursion

### Definition
**Tail Recursion** occurs when a recursive function calls itself as the **last statement** in the function, with no operations performed after the recursive call returns.

### Key Characteristics
- The recursive call is the final operation
- All processing happens during the **calling phase**
- No operations are performed during the **returning phase**
- Function doesn't need to wait for the recursive call to complete before finishing

### Example of Tail Recursion
```cpp
void fun(int n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        printf("%d ", n);
        fun(n - 1);  // Last statement - this makes it tail recursion
    }
}
```

### Non-Tail Recursion Example
```cpp
void fun(int n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        printf("%d ", n);
        fun(n - 1) + n;  // Operation after recursive call - NOT tail recursion
    }
}
```

**Why it's not tail recursion:** The addition operation (`+ n`) must be performed after the recursive call returns, meaning work is done during the returning phase.

## 2. Tail Recursion vs Loops

### Conversion to Loop
Every tail recursive function can be easily converted to a loop (and vice versa).

**Tail Recursive Version:**
```cpp
void fun(int n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        printf("%d ", n);
        fun(n - 1);
    }
}
```

**Equivalent Loop Version:**
```cpp
void fun(int n) {
    while (n > 0) {
        printf("%d ", n);
        n--;
    }
}
```

### Performance Comparison

| Aspect | Tail Recursion | Loop |
|--------|----------------|------|
| **Time Complexity** | O(n) | O(n) |
| **Space Complexity** | O(n) | O(1) |
| **Activation Records** | n+1 records | 1 record |

### Space Analysis
- **Tail Recursion:** Creates multiple activation records on the stack (one for each recursive call)
  - For `fun(3)`: Creates 4 activation records (n=3, n=2, n=1, n=0)
  - Space complexity: **O(n)**

- **Loop:** Uses only one activation record throughout execution
  - Space complexity: **O(1)** (constant)

### Efficiency Conclusion
- **Time:** Both approaches have the same time complexity
- **Space:** Loops are more space-efficient for tail recursion scenarios
- **Recommendation:** Convert tail recursion to loops for better space efficiency

## 3. Compiler Optimization

### Tail Call Optimization
- Modern compilers can automatically optimize tail recursive functions
- They convert tail recursion into loop-like code during compilation
- This reduces space complexity from O(n) to O(1)
- The optimization happens at the object code level

### Benefits
- Automatic space optimization
- Maintains recursive code readability
- Achieves loop-like efficiency

## Key Takeaways

1. **Tail recursion** = recursive call is the last statement
2. **All processing** happens during the calling phase in tail recursion
3. **Loops are more space-efficient** than tail recursion
4. **Easy conversion** between tail recursion and loops
5. **Compiler optimization** can automatically improve tail recursive functions
6. **Time complexity** remains the same, but **space complexity** differs significantly

## 4. Head Recursion

### Definition
**Head Recursion** occurs when a recursive function calls itself as the **first statement** in the function, with all processing/operations performed **after** the recursive call returns.

### Key Characteristics
- The recursive call is the **first operation**
- **No processing** happens during the calling phase
- **All operations** are performed during the **returning phase**
- Function must wait for recursive calls to complete before doing any work

### Structure of Head Recursion
```cpp
void fun(int n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        fun(n - 1);        // First statement - recursive call
        printf("%d ", n);  // Processing after recursive call
    }
}
```

### Example Analysis
For `fun(3)`, the execution flow:
1. **Calling Phase:** `fun(3)` → `fun(2)` → `fun(1)` → `fun(0)`
2. **Returning Phase:** Print 1 → Print 2 → Print 3
3. **Output:** `1 2 3`

### What Makes It Head Recursion?
- **✅ Valid Head Recursion:** No statements before the recursive call
- **❌ Not Head Recursion:** Any operation before the recursive call
```cpp
// NOT Head Recursion
void fun(int n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        printf("Before call\n");  // Operation before recursive call
        fun(n - 1);
        printf("%d ", n);
    }
}
```

## 5. Head Recursion vs Loops

### Conversion Difficulty
Head recursion **cannot be easily converted** to loops in a straightforward manner.

### Direct Conversion Attempt (Doesn't Work)
```cpp
// Head Recursive Version
void fun(int n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        fun(n - 1);
        printf("%d ", n);
    }
}
// Output: 1 2 3

// Attempted Direct Loop Conversion
void fun(int n) {
    while (n > 0) {
        printf("%d ", n);  // This prints 3 2 1, not 1 2 3
        n--;
    }
}
// Output: 3 2 1 (Wrong!)
```

### Correct Loop Equivalent
To achieve the same output (`1 2 3`), we need a different approach:
```cpp
void fun(int n) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", i);
    }
}
// Output: 1 2 3 (Correct!)
```

### Key Insight
- The loop version looks **completely different** from the recursive structure
- **Direct structural conversion** is not possible
- We need to **redesign the logic** to achieve the same result

## 6. Comparison: Tail vs Head Recursion

| Aspect | Tail Recursion | Head Recursion |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Recursive Call Position** | Last statement | First statement |
| **Processing Phase** | During calling | During returning |
| **Loop Conversion** | Easy & direct | Difficult & indirect |
| **Structure Similarity** | Maintains similar structure | Requires complete redesign |
| **Execution Order** | Forward (3→2→1) | Reverse (1→2→3) |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Head recursion** = recursive call is the **first statement**
2. **All processing** happens during the **returning phase**
3. **Cannot be easily converted** to loops (unlike tail recursion)
4. **Loop equivalents** require completely different logic structure
5. **Execution pattern** creates reverse order output compared to input
6. **Structural conversion** is not straightforward - requires algorithmic redesign
